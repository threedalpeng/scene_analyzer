War Machine's mace is broken.]\nJames Rhodes: Great.\nScott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]\nJames Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]\nScott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]\nJames Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.\nNatasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?\nTony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them.

He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]\n[Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]\nPeter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.\nSteve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.\nPeter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]\nSam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?\nClint Barton: Buckled in?\nScott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]\nSteve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?\nPeter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]\nSteve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?\nPeter Parker: Queens.\nSteve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]\nTony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?\nFRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.\nTony Stark: They what?\nScott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.\nTony Stark: Who's speaking?\nScott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.\nTony Stark: Friday?\nFRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.\nScott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa!

That guy's probably in Siberia by now.\nSteve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.\nSam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.\nClint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.\nSam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.\nSteve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?\nSam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.\nScott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.\nBucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?\nSteve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?\nScott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]\nPeter Parker: Holy shit!\nJames Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.\nSteve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.\nSam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!\nTony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]\nPeter Parker: I got him!

Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past.

Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]\nScott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]\n[Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]\nClint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.\nT'Challa: I don't care.

War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]\nJames Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]\nScott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]\nNatasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.\nSteve Rogers: You know I can't.\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this.

He's on the young side.\nPeter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies?

Go high.\nPeter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]\nScott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?\nTony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?\nPeter Parker: Hey! Get off me!\nTony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.\nPeter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.\nTony Stark: Yeah.\nPeter Parker: That was scary.\nTony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?\nPeter Parker: What?\nTony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.\nPeter Parker: No, I'm good.

I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.\nNatasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it.

A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]", "scene": 42}

To see them rip each other apart.\nHelmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, \"Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm.\" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.\nT'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me.

Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit.

I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . .
